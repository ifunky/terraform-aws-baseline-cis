  This module will set up an AWS account with the a basic secure configuration baseline based on [CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations] v1.2.0.

  [CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations]: https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services/

  ## Features

  ### Identity and Access Management

  - Set up IAM Password complxity policy.
  - Creates an IAM role for contacting AWS support for incident handling.
  - Enable AWS Config rules to audit root account status (NOT ENABLED).

  ### Logging & Monitoring

  - Enable CloudTrail in all regions and deliver events to CloudWatch Logs.
  - CloudTrail logs are encrypted using AWS Key Management Service.
  - All logs are stored in the S3 bucket with access logging enabled.
  - Logs are automatically archived into Amazon Glacier after the given period(defaults to 90 days).
  - Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify you when critical changes happen in your AWS account.
  - Creates default CloudWatch dashboards based on the security alarms
  - Enable AWS Config in all regions to automatically take configuration snapshots (NOT ENABLED).
  - Enable SecurityHub and subscribe CIS benchmark standard.

  ### Networking

  - Remove rules in the default security group.
  - Enable AWS Config rules to audit unrestricted common ports in Security Group rules.
  - Enable VPC Flow Logs (REJECT) in all regions.

  ### Cloudwatch Alarms
  - Set of alarms for each of the CIS recommended checks
  - SNS alerts for alarms
  - Clousdwatch dashboards

  #### Control Tower
  If your management account is managed by Control Tower it will manage CloudTrail and logging so this module 
  can be set to ignore these resources with the `is_managed_by_control_tower` setting.

  > NOTE: This module doesn't create S3 buckets, this is assumed to be in place already
